Personal Learning Goals:
Getting User input at the console level
--pretty much everything else I think I know


aside:
I come from an intro C# background with 0 formal webdesign background.
I prefer honest reviews. I'm still new, and don't want to start any bad habits. 
Please review this and offer improvements, but be sure to include why!
